	<div id="content">
		<p class="description"> For my midterm project I will be creating a web application that allows users to have their own garden, or set of plants to maintain and take care of. Every user will have a little ecosystem of their own that updates in real time.</p>

		<p class="description">The idea is to have the user maintain their plants and keep them alive by watering them, each plant will require to be watered at different frequencies and will grow in their own way. I'm still unsure if I'm going to model my plant objects off of real plants or generate my own.</p>

		<p class="description">For my back end I will be using Google's Firebase, and on the front end I will be using p5.js with jQuery worked in to handle UI components for the app. Ideally, I will be creating my own graphics and music to match this environment.</p>
